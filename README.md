# Data Science Bootcamp - 15 Days üöÄ
## Suresh Gyan Vihar University Jaipur, Rajasthan 

Welcome to the **Data Science Bootcamp** repository! This repository contains all the assignments and projects I completed during a 15-day intensive Data Science Bootcamp at my college. Each day, we focused on a different aspect of Data Science, ranging from data analysis, machine learning, and statistics to deep learning.

## üóìÔ∏è Bootcamp Overview
**Duration:** 15 Days  
**Assignments:** 15 (One per day)  

**Topics Covered:**
- Python for Data Science
- Data Wrangling and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning Basics
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Model Evaluation and Selection
- Introduction to Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Time Series Analysis

Each day's folder contains:
- **Assignment Notebook** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Data Files** (if any)
- **README** for quick reference
